This is my fist time making a website with nice designs for fun and learning how to kind of "code." I hope this will be a new way for me to post up pictures (screenshots) from the game in a more neat fashion instead of the lodestone.
I may setup a comment section but I still need to figure how to do so.
Well I hope you will enjoy the little simple screenshot blog I guess!! And will need to actually do both in English and Japanese. (´･ω･｀)

Ah I might do two separate ones once I figure it out. See you in the next blog!('ω')ノ
